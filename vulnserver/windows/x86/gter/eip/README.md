# EIP Overwrite/Overflow GTER in VulnServer

This one was even more fun than some of the others!  There was very little room in the buffer with the EIP overwrite so I used an egghunter mixed with sending a previous command that did not cause an overflow into the server so that it would be in memory and able to be found!
