# SEH Overflow LTER in VulnServer

Now this one was fun ... there was very little room to play with but fourtunatly when the shellcode is passed in as **0xFF** in the overflow it treats it as an **0x80** which allowed for me to jump backwards up the stack and then use add/sub encoding to push in the egg hunter into the stack below ... which then let us find the egg that we sent through on the first request!
